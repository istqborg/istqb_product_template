## question
Which of the following factors (i-v) have SIGNIFICANT influence on the test process?

i. The SDLC  
ii. The number of defects detected in previous projects  
iii. The identified product risks  
iv. New regulatory requirements forcing  
v. The number of certified testers in the organization  

## answers
a. i, ii have significant influence; iii, iv, v have not  
b. i, iii, iv have significant influence; ii, v have not  
c. ii, iv, v have significant influence; i, iii have not  
d. iii, v have significant influence; i, ii, iv have not  

## justification
i.   Is true. The SDLC has an influence on the test process  
ii.  Is false. The number of defects detected in previous projects may have
     some influence, but this is not as significant as i, iii and iv  
iii. Is true. The identified product risks are one of the most important
     factors influencing the test process  
iv.  Is true. Regulatory requirements are important factors influencing the
     test process  
v.   Is false. The test environment should be a copy of the production
     environment but has no significant influence on the test process  

Hence b is correct.
