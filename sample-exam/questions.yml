  1:
    learning-objective: 1.1.1
    k-level: K1
    number-of-points: 1
    question: Which of the following statements describe a valid test objective?
    answers:
      a: To prove that there are no unfixed defects in the system under test
      b: To prove that there will be no failures after the implementation of the system into production
      c: To reduce the risk level of the test object and to build confidence in the quality level
      d: To verify that there are no untested combinations of inputs
    correct: c
    explanation: |
      a) Is not correct. It is impossible to prove that there are no defects anymore in the system under test.
         See testing principle 1
      b) Is not correct. See testing principle 7
      c) Is correct. Testing finds defects and failures which reduces the level of risk and at the same time
         gives more confidence in the quality level of the test object
      d) Is not correct. It is impossible to test all combinations of inputs (see testing principle 2)

    learning-objective: 1.4.2
    k-level: K2
    number-of-points: 1
    question: |
      Which of the following factors (i-v) have SIGNIFICANT influence on the test process?

      i. The SDLC
      ii. The number of defects detected in previous projects
      iii. The identified product risks
      iv. New regulatory requirements forcing
      v. The number of certified testers in the organization
    answers:
      a: i, ii have significant influence; iii, iv, v have not
      b: i, iii, iv have significant influence; ii, v have not
      c: ii, iv, v have significant influence; i, iii have not
      d: iii, v have significant influence; i, ii, iv have not
    correct: b
    explanation: |
      i.   Is true. The SDLC has an influence on the test process
      ii.  Is false. The number of defects detected in previous projects may have
           some influence, but this is not as significant as i, iii and iv
      iii. Is true. The identified product risks are one of the most important
           factors influencing the test process
      iv.  Is true. Regulatory requirements are important factors influencing the
           test process
      v.   Is false. The test environment should be a copy of the production
           environment but has no significant influence on the test process

      Hence b is correct.
  6:
    learning-objective: 1.4.5
    k-level: K2
    number-of-points: 1
    question: Which TWO of the following tasks belong MAINLY to a testing role?
    answers:
      a: Configure test environments
      b: Maintain the product backlog
      c: Design solutions to new requirements
      d: Create the test plan
      e: Report on achieved coverage
    correct: [a, e]
    explanation: |
      a) Is correct. This is done by the testers
      b) Is not correct. The product backlog is built and maintained by the product owner
      c) Is not correct. This is done by the development team
      d) Is not correct. This is a managerial role
      e) Is correct. This is done by the testers

  7:
    learning-objective: 1.4.2
    k-level: K2
    number-of-points: 1
    question: |
      Given the following test activities and tasks:

      A. Test design
      B. Test implementation
      C. Test execution
      D. Test completion

      1. Entering change requests for open defect reports
      2. Identifying test data to support the test cases
      3. Prioritizing test procedures and creating test data
      4. Analyzing discrepancies to determine their cause

      Which of the following BEST matches the activities with the tasks?
    answers:
      a: A-2, B-3, C-4, D-1
      b: A-2, B-1, C-3, D-4
      c: A-3, B-2, C-4, D-1
      d: A-3, B-2, C-1, D-4
    correct: a
    explanation: |
      The correct pairing of test activities and tasks is:

      A. Test design – (2) Identifying test data to support the test cases
      B. Test implementation – (3) Prioritizing test procedures and creating test data
      C. Test execution – (4) Analyzing discrepancies to determine their cause
      D. Test completion – (1) Entering change requests for open defect reports

      Thus:

      a) Is correct
      b) Is not correct
      c) Is not correct
      d) Is not correct
