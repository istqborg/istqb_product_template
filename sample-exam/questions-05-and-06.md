## question
Arrange the following test analysis activities in their chronological order:

1. Define test conditions for each test item
2. Involve stakeholders in reviewing the test conditions
3. Review the test basis for testability
4. Check that test objectives and test approach are clear

## justification
a) Is correct.  
* Checking that test objectives and test approach are clear is a precondition to test analysis, so activity 4 must come first. 
* Reviewing the test basis for testability is one of the first activities of test analysis, providing early feedback. So, activity 3 must come next and must precede activity 2 (defining test conditions).
* The TA can define test conditions (activity 1) as soon as all preconditions are met (activity 4), and the quality of the test basis is appropriate (activity 3).  
* Stakeholders can only review the test conditions (activity 2) once the test conditions have been defined (activity 1).  
b) Is not correct. See the answer to a).  
c) Is not correct. See the answer to a).  
d) Is not correct. See the answer to a).

## question
Assign tasks in the list (1-5) to test activities of a test analyst (A-B)?

1. Run test suites
2. Report anomalies based on the failures observed
3. Verify why a test case failed
4. Identify incorrect test data
5. Update the risk levels of test conditions
6. Run confirmation tests

A. The TA executes tests manually
B. The TA analyzes anomalies, logs the test results, and communicates defects
C. The TA updates the traceability

## justification
The activity 'The TA executes tests manually' contains the following tasks:

* Run test suites
* Run confirmation tests.

Note that a test run is the execution of a test on a specific version of the test object (see the Glossary). 

The activity 'The TA analyzes anomalies, logs the the test results, and communicates defects' contains the following tasks:

* Report anomalies based on the failures observed
* Verify why a test case failed
* Identify incorrect test data

The activity 'The TA updates the traceability' contains the following task:

* Update the risk levels of test conditions
