## question
Which of the following statements describe a valid test objective?

## answers
a. To prove that there are no unfixed defects in the system under test  
b. To prove that there will be no failures after the implementation of the system into production  
c. To reduce the risk level of the test object and to build confidence in the quality level  
d. To verify that there are no untested combinations of inputs  

## justification
a. Is not correct. It is impossible to prove that there are no defects anymore in the system under test.
   See testing principle 1  
b. Is not correct. See testing principle 7  
c. Is correct. Testing finds defects and failures which reduces the level of risk and at the same time
   gives more confidence in the quality level of the test object  
d. Is not correct. It is impossible to test all combinations of inputs (see testing principle 2)
