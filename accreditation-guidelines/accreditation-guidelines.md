# Introduction

## Purpose of these Accreditation Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for the evaluation of ISTQB® CT-TEMP training by an accreditation panel commissioned by an ISTQB® member board or its agent. It provides guidance to:

* Training Material Owners who want to create Training Material that will be successfully accredited
* Members of the accreditation panel who evaluates the Training Material
* Member boards or their agent who selects the members of the accreditation panel


# Overall Rules

The following rules apply to the accreditation of CTAL-ATLaS training material:

1. Traceability and completeness: The Training Material to be accredited shall demonstrate coverage of all applicable learning objectives. Applications for accreditation shall include a traceability matrix showing coverage of the learning objectives in terms of presentation and supporting materials.
2. Timing: For each module, all chapters shall be covered with at least as much time as required in the syllabus. Applications for accreditation shall include a timing matrix showing the time allocated per chapter.
3. Content: The training material shall provide the student with the knowledge and skills of each chapter and section as outlined in the CTAL-ATLaS syllabus and body of knowledge (see section 2.1.1 Content below).
4. Glossary: For any term defined, the Training Material shall be consistent with the definition of that term in the current version of the ISTQBâ Glossary.
5. Examples: All K2, K3 and K4 learning objectives shall contain at least one realistic software or systems project example (see section 2.1.2 Examples below).
6. Exercises and solutions: All K3 and K4 learning objectives shall have at least one practical, nontrivial exercise drawn from a realistic, software or systems project (see section 2.1.3 Exercises and Answers below).
7. Hands-on Objectives: Exercises for HOs are mandatory (see chapter 3 Hands-On Objectives below).
8. Full review: Accreditation panel may not use sampling methods (i.e., evaluating some sections instead of the full Training Material). All Training Material provided shall be evaluated.

# Evaluation

## Evaluation of Training Material

### Content
The training course and Training Material shall appeal to different styles of learning:

* visual
* auditory
* reading/writing
* kinesthetic.

The slides, videos, exercises, exercise solutions, and other Training Material shall be consistent with the content of the CTAL-ATLaS Syllabus and Body of Knowledge (BOK).

The Training Material shall not be a direct copy of the content in CTAL-ATLaS Body of Knowledge (BOK) or the ATLaS pilot training material (PTM).

It is allowed to be heavily inspired by the ATLaS PTM supplied by ISTQB®. The ATLaS PTM was created during the development of CTAL-ATLaS and was used for collecting early and final feedback in various pilots. The ATLaS PTM does not include visual effects or tool support which is normally included in professional training material. The accreditation panel shall still evaluate training material which was created based on ATLaS PTM. The usage of ATLaS PTM is optional and does not guarantee accreditation.

Training Material may cover additional learning objectives, topics and/or additional terms. Accreditation panels shall not consider these as part of the accreditation process unless contradictory with or derogatory towards the ISTQB® program, in which case accreditation shall be denied.

### Examples

All K2, K3 and K4 learning objective shall contain at least one example. Examples shall be appropriate for the module being taught and shall be drawn upon realistic software or system projects. Ideally, examples should be substantiated and be drawn from real life occurrences.

### Exercises and Answers
Exercises shall be appropriate for the module and K-level or HO-level taught, adapted to the module being taught, and shall be drawn upon realistic software or systems projects. Ideally, exercises should be substantiated and be drawn from real life occurrences. Each exercise should also include a solution.

For classes, mandatory exercises shall either be solved by the students in class (i.e., not as optional) and a solution shall be reviewed in class by the trainer or be solved by students at home. If mandatory exercises should be done as homework the allocated time should be subtracted from the training duration. A solution shall still be reviewed in the class by the trainer for exercises done as homework. Additional exercises can be solved as homework without the solution being reviewed in class.

For self-study courses, like e-learning or correspondence classes, an exercise solution shall be provided in the Training Material. Furthermore, the student shall be able to get questions related to his answer and the exercise solution answered by a trainer within a reasonable time frame.

### Evaluation of Trainer Notes

Training Material may include instructions for the trainer in the form of trainer notes. These "trainer notes" can be "presenter notes" in the slides or a separate document.

If it is unclear how the Training Material covers parts of the mandatory content of CTAL-ATLaS, even with trainer notes, the Training Material Owner shall provide additional documentation that explains how the mandatory content is covered.

## Evaluation of Additional Material

If the Training Material Owner references additional material (such as books, websites or videos not referenced in CTAL-ATLaS), they shall provide that material to the accreditation panel and ensure that this material is not in conflict with the CTAL-ATLaS and other ISTQB® syllabi.

## Evaluation of the Members of the Accreditation Panel

At least one member of the accreditation panel shall have at least 3 years of experience in organizations scaling agile preferably using one of the common frameworks, e.g., SAFeâ, LeSS, Spotify model. The experience can be gained over a longer time period and in different organizations. It is highly recommended that a member has experienced an agile transformation at scale, either as part of a team, project or program. Working in an organization using frameworks for agile transformation without direct experience with the teams who build and deliver the solutions is not sufficient.

At least one member of the accreditation panel shall hold the Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale certification. This criterion does not apply for the first 18 months after the release of the certification. 


# Hands-On Objectives (HOs)

Like K3 Learning Objectives (LOs), Hands-on Objectives (HOs) focus on practical skills and competencies. However, HOs are not examined by the multiple-choice exam questions. It is therefore important that HOs are well covered by the Training Material.

## Competence Guidelines

Competence guidelines provides further information on the purpose of a HO exercise.

The exercises mentioned in this document will also help those undertaking self-study to understand the kinds of hands-on exercises they need to do to master the competencies. It shall also help the training material owner create appropriate hands-on exercises for accreditation.

Each hands-on exercise requires a realistic problem or an application. If a hands-on exercise requires an application the installer files for these applications or the link to the respective stores or websites from where the applications can be installed shall be part of the submitted material.

All hands-on exercises shall be submitted with the outcomes of the exercise such as the bugs to be found, platforms to be selected, behavior to be observed, together with other submissions as per the accreditation guidelines.

The following table explains how exercises for each HO Objective in Advanced Level Agile Testing at Scale could be conducted. It is only meant as an inspiration and the Training Material Owner is free to design the exercises differently.
