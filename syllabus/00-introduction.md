# Introduction

## Purpose of this Syllabus

This syllabus forms the basis for the International Software Testing Qualification for the \<subject\> if applicable at the \<module name\>. The ISTQB® provides this syllabus as follows:

1. To member boards, to translate into their local language and to accredit training providers. Member boards may adapt the syllabus to their particular language needs and modify the references to adapt to their local publications.
2. To certification bodies, to derive examination questions in their local language adapted to the learning objectives for this syllabus.
3. To training providers, to produce courseware and determine appropriate teaching methods.
4. To certification candidates, to prepare for the certification exam (either as part of a training course or independently).
5. To the international software and systems engineering community, to advance the profession of software and systems testing, and as a basis for books and articles.

## The \<module-name\> in Software Testing

The ISTQB® \<module-name\> (CT-\<module-code\>) certification focuses on organizing and improving quality and testing across multiple teams in an agile organization. It also covers how to approach quality and testing at a strategic level in order to achieve higher business agility in an organization.

The \<module-code\> qualification is aimed at people who work in organizations that are pursuing agility at scale or business agility and already have a basic understanding of Agile software development and agile testing.

This includes people in roles such as test manager, head of testing, quality coach, agile test leader, agile test team leader, test analyst, technical test analyst, test automation engineer, quality engineer, quality assurance, member of an agile team, member of a leadership team leading multiple agile teams, IT director, project manager, release train engineer, scrum master, product owner, and management consultant.

## Career Path for Testers

The ISTQB® scheme provides support for testing professionals at all stages of their careers offering both breadth and depth of knowledge.

The Advanced Level \<module-name\> builds on the qualifications in Foundation Level Certified Tester and Foundation Level Agile Tester. Certified Tester provides the basic knowledge and competencies in software testing. Agile Tester expands on Certified Tester and explains how testing is performed in an agile team.

As \<module-code\> focuses on the organizational level, it supplements the Advanced Level Agile Technical Tester which focuses on technical practices. It also supplements Advanced Level Test Management, which focuses on projects and not on organizational aspects. In addition, Advanced Level Test Management covers traditional approaches and hybrid approaches.

Individuals who achieve the ISTQB® \<module-code\> certification may also be interested in the other Core Advanced Level certifications Test Management and Test Analyst, and the Specialist certifications especially Test Automation Engineer, AI Testing and Model-Based Tester

## Business Outcomes

This section lists the Business Outcomes expected of a candidate who has achieved the \<module-code\> certification.

An \<module-code\> Certified Test Leader can…

* \<module-code\> - BO2 Business Outcomes 2 details
* \<module-code\> - BO3 Business Outcomes 3 details

## Learning Objectives, Hands-on Objectives and Cognitive Level of Knowledge

Learning and Hands-on Objectives support the business outcomes and are used to create the \<module name\> exams. If the syllabus does not include Hands-on objectives, remove all reference to “Hands-on objectives” in this section.

In general, all contents of this syllabus are examinable, except for the Introduction, Hands-on Objectives and Appendices. The exam questions will confirm knowledge of keywords at K1 level (see below) or learning objectives at all K-levels.
The specific learning objectives levels are shown at the beginning of each chapter, and classified as follows:

* K1: Remember
* K2: Understand
* K3: Apply
* K4: Analyze
* K5: Evaluate
* K6: Create

Further details and examples of learning objectives are given in <#section:cognitive-levels>.
For all terms listed as keywords just below chapter headings, the correct name and definition from the ISTQB® glossary shall be remembered (K1), even if not explicitly mentioned in the learning objective.

The specific Hands-on Objectives (when applicable) are shown at the beginning of each chapter. The level of a HO is classified as follows:  

* H0: This can include a live demo of an exercise or recorded video. Since this is not performed by the trainee, it is not strictly an exercise.  
* H1: Guided exercise. The trainees follow a sequence of steps performed by the trainer.  
* H2: Exercise with hints. The trainee is given an exercise with relevant hints to enable the exercise to be solved within the given timeframe.  
* H3: Unguided exercises without hints.  


## The \<module-name\> Certification Exam

The \<module-code\> Certification exam will be based on this syllabus. Answers to exam questions may require the use of material based on more than one section of this syllabus. All sections of the syllabus are examinable, except for the Introduction and Appendices. Standards and books are included as references, but their content is not examinable, beyond what is summarized in the syllabus itself from such standards and books.

Refer to Exam Structures and Rules document for the \<module-name\> (e.g. Exam Structures and Rules V1.1 Compatible with Syllabus Foundation and Advanced Levels and Specialists Modules) document for further details.

The entry criterion for taking the \<module-name\> exam (e.g. ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Software Testing) is that candidates have an interest in software testing. However, it is strongly recommended that candidates also: 

* Have at least a minimal background in either software development or software testing, such as six months experience as a system or user acceptance tester or as a software developer
* Take a course that has been accredited to ISTQB® standards (by one of the ISTQB-recognized member boards).
Entry Requirement Note: The ISTQB® Foundation Level certificate shall be obtained before taking the \<module-code\> certification exam.

## Accreditation

An ISTQB® Member Board may accredit training providers whose course material follows this syllabus. Training providers should obtain accreditation guidelines from the Member Board or body that performs the accreditation. An accredited course is recognized as conforming to this syllabus, and is allowed to have an ISTQB® exam as part of the course.

The accreditation guidelines for this syllabus follow the general Accreditation Guidelines published by the Processes Management and Compliance Working Group.

## Handling of Standard

There are standards associated with software quality characteristics and software testing, namely the ones referenced in the Foundational Level syllabus like IEEE and ISO. The purpose of these references is to provide a framework (as in the references to ISO 25010 regarding quality characteristics) or to provide a source of additional information if desired by the reader.  Please note that syllabi are using the standard documents as reference. Standards documents are not intended for examination. Refer to <#section:references> for more information on Standards.

## Level of Detail

The level of detail in this syllabus allows internationally consistent courses and exams. In order to achieve this goal, the syllabus consists of:

*	General instructional objectives describing the intention of the \<module-name\> Level
*	A list of terms that students must be able to recall 
*	Learning objectives for each knowledge area, describing the cognitive learning outcome to be achieved
*	A description of the key concepts, including references to sources such as accepted literature or standards

The syllabus content is not a description of the entire knowledge area of software testing; it reflects the level of detail to be covered in < Module name>Level training courses. It focuses on test concepts and techniques that can apply to all software projects, including those following Agile methods.  This syllabus does not contain any specific learning objectives related to Agile testing, but it does discuss how these concepts apply in Agile projects and other types of projects.  

The syllabus uses the terminology (i.e. the name and meaning) of the terms used in software testing and quality assurance according to the ISTQB® Glossary.
For the terminology in related disciplines please refer to the respective glossaries: IREB-CPRE for requirements engineering, IEEE-Pascal for software engineering, and Agile Alliance for agile terminology.

## How this Syllabus is Organized {#how-this-syllabus-is-organized}
