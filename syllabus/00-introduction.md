## Learning Objectives, Hands-on Objectives and Cognitive Level of Knowledge

Learning and Hands-on Objectives support the business outcomes and are used to create the \<module-name\> exams.

In general, all contents of this syllabus are examinable, except for the Introduction, Hands-on Objectives and Appendices. The exam questions will confirm knowledge of keywords at K1 level (see below) or learning objectives at the respective level of knowledge.

The specific learning objectives and their levels of knowledge are shown at the beginning of each chapter, and classified as follows:

* K1: Remember
* K2: Understand
* K3: Apply
* K4: Analyze
* K5: Evaluate
* K6: Create

Further details and examples of learning objectives are given in <#section:cognitive-levels>.

For all terms listed as keywords just below chapter headings, the correct name and definition from the ISTQB® glossary shall be remembered (K1), even if not explicitly mentioned in the learning objective.

The specific Hands-on Objectives (when applicable) are shown at the beginning of each chapter. The level of a HO is classified as follows:  

* H0: This can include a live demo of an exercise or recorded video. Since this is not performed by the trainee, it is not strictly an exercise.  
* H1: Guided exercise. The trainees follow a sequence of steps performed by the trainer.  
* H2: Exercise with hints. The trainee is given an exercise with relevant hints to enable the exercise to be solved within the given timeframe.  
* H3: Unguided exercises without hints.  

## The \<module-name\> Certification Exam

The \<module-name\> Certificate exam will be based on this syllabus. Answers to exam questions may require the use of material based on more than one section of this syllabus. All sections of the syllabus are examinable, except for the Introduction and Appendices. Standards and books are included as references, but their content is not examinable, beyond what is summarized in the syllabus itself from such standards and books.

Refer to Exam Structures and Rules document for the \<module-name\> (e.g. Exam Structures and Rules V1.1 Compatible with Syllabus Foundation and Advanced Levels and Specialists Modules) document for further details.

The entry criterion for taking the\<module-name\> exam (e.g.ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Software Testing) is that candidates are interested in software testing. However, it is strongly recommended that candidates also: 

* Have at least a minimal background in either software development or software testing, such as six months experience as a system or user acceptance tester or as a software developer
* Take a course that has been accredited to ISTQB® standards (by one of the ISTQB-recognized member boards).

Entry Requirement Note: The ISTQB® Foundation Level certificate shall be obtained before taking the \<module-name\> certification exam.

## Accreditation

An ISTQB® Member Board may accredit training providers whose course material follows this syllabus. Training providers should obtain accreditation guidelines from the Member Board or body that performs the accreditation. An accredited course is recognized as conforming to this syllabus, and is allowed to have an ISTQB® exam as part of the course.
