# Introduction

## Purpose of this Syllabus
This syllabus outlines the scope of the \<module-name\> certification.

Together with the \<module-code\> body of knowledge the syllabus forms the basis for the International Software Testing Qualification for \<module-name\> at the Advanced Level. The ISTQB® provides this syllabus as follows:

1.  To Member Boards, to translate into their local language and to accredit training providers.  
Member boards may adapt the syllabus to their particular language needs and modify the references to adapt to their local publications.
1.  To certification bodies, to derive examination questions in their local language adapted to the learning objectives for this syllabus.
1.  To training providers, to produce courseware and determine appropriate teaching methods.
1.  To certification candidates, to prepare for the certification exam (either as part of a training course or independently).
1.  To the international software and systems engineering community, to advance the profession of software and systems testing, and as a basis for books and articles.

## The \<module-name\> Certification

The ISTQB® \<module-name\> (CTAL-\<module-code\>) certification focuses on organizing and improving quality and testing across multiple teams in an agile organization. It also covers how to approach quality and testing at a strategic level in order to achieve higher business agility in an organization.

The \<module-code\> qualification is aimed at people who work in organizations that are pursuing agility at scale or business agility and already have a basic understanding of Agile software development and agile testing.

This includes people in roles such as test manager, head of testing, quality coach, agile test leader, agile test team leader, test analyst, technical test analyst, test automation engineer, quality engineer, quality assurance, member of an agile team, member of a leadership team leading multiple agile teams, IT director, project manager, release train engineer, scrum master, product owner, and management consultant.

## Career Path for Testers
The ISTQB® scheme provides support for testing professionals at all stages of their careers offering both breadth and depth of knowledge.

The Advanced Level \<module-name\> builds on the qualifications in Foundation Level Certified Tester and Foundation Level Agile Tester. Certified Tester provides the basic knowledge and competencies in software testing. Agile Tester expands on Certified Tester and explains how testing is performed in an agile team.

As \<module-code\> focuses on the organizational level, it supplements the Advanced Level Agile Technical Tester which focuses on technical practices. It also supplements Advanced Level Test Management, which focuses on projects and not on organizational aspects. In addition, Advanced Level Test Management covers traditional approaches and hybrid approaches.

Individuals who achieve the ISTQB® \<module-code\> certification may also be interested in the other Core Advanced Level certifications Test Management and Test Analyst, and the Specialist certifications especially Test Automation Engineer, AI Testing and Model-Based Tester

## Business Context

Organizations strive to improve their business agility to provide valuable products and services in a changing world. A key way to improve business agility is to transform the culture and mindset by using different principles, frameworks, disciplines, and methodologies such as agile, lean, and DevOps, which we here cover with the term "business agility". One common principle in these frameworks and disciplines is the focus on delivering value with the quality that customers demand, i.e., customer-focused.  
Therefore, the term value-driven is used to describe organizations that strive to achieve business agility regardless of their various ways of working.

Agile software development started as a way to improve how software was delivered iteratively. It focused on a small delivery team that could release software in shorter iterations than the traditional software development lifecycles. As the popularity of the Agile software development grew, it became apparent that at times there was a need for several delivery teams to collaborate in order to develop larger and more complex systems (also called a team of agile teams). Therefore, new frameworks were created in order to scale agile from individual agile delivery teams to multiple delivery teams contributing to the value of the solution. Delivery teams often consist of people from different organizations that work together to provide the overall solution. This move from focusing on individual delivery teams to multiple teams is called "agile at scale" or "scaled agile." This also requires that testing approaches are scaled.

Scaling agile is not necessarily the same as business agility, which includes the entire enterprise, but in order to achieve business agility an organization could benefit from adopting agile at scale.

With business agility there is an even greater need for accelerated quality. This is not achievable if all responsibility for quality remains in the individual teams or specific roles such as testers. Therefore, test management moves to quality management and organizations need to adopt quality assistance across the organization as well as within delivery teams. This changes the role of quality assurance and test professionals to be closer to agile test leadership and to fostering a quality culture and mindset.

## Examinable Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level of Knowledge

Learning objectives support the business outcomes and are used to create the \<module-code\> exams.

In general, all content of this syllabus are examinable at a K1 level, except for the Introduction and Appendices. That is, the candidate may be asked to recognize, remember, or recall a keyword or concept mentioned in any of the chapters. The specific learning objectives levels are shown at the beginning of each chapter, and classified as follows:

* K1: Remember
* K2: Understand
* K3: Apply
* K4: Analyze
* K5: Evaluate
* K6: Create

Further details and examples of learning objectives are given in Appendix A.

All terms listed as keywords just below chapter headings shall be remembered (K1), even if not explicitly mentioned in the learning objectives.

## Non-Examinable Hands-On Objectives

LOs and hands-on objectives (HOs) focus on practical skills and competencies. However, HOs are not examined by the multiple-choice exam questions. It is expected that HOs are covered either as part of an accredited training or as self-study. HOs are listed at the beginning of each chapter together with the LOs.

The level of an HO is classified as follows:

* H0: This can include a live demo of an exercise or recorded video. Since this is not performed by the trainee, it is not strictly an exercise.
* H1: Guided exercise. The trainees follow a sequence of steps performed by the trainer.
* H2: Exercise with hints. The trainee is given an exercise with relevant hints to enable the exercise to be solved within the given timeframe.
* H3: Unguided exercises without hints.
 
Training material owners and people who self-study can find additional guidance on how to include practical elements to fulfil HOs in the \<module-code\> Accreditation Guidelines

## The \<module-name\> Certificate Exam

The \<module-code\> Certificate exam will be based on both this syllabus and the body of knowledge. Answers to exam questions may require the use of material based on more than one section of this syllabus. All sections of the syllabus are examinable, except for the Introduction and Appendices. Standards and books are included as references, but their content is not examinable, beyond what is summarized in this syllabus and the \<module-code\> body of knowledge from such standards and books.

Refer to the Exam Structures and Rules document to understand the general exam rules.

Refer to the page for \<module-code\> in the Exam Structure Table document for details about how a \<module-code\> exam is composed.

The entry criteria for taking the \<module-code\> exam are:

* either the ISTQB® Foundation Level certificate v4.0
* or a version older than v4.0 of the ISTQB® Foundation Level certificate and the ISTQB® Agile Tester Foundation Level certificate

When the ISTQB® Agile Tester Foundation Level no longer is available, the ISTQB® Foundation Level certificate v4.0 will become the only entry criterion.

It is strongly recommended that candidates also:

* Have at least three years of experience working in an agile team or an agile organization
* Take a course that has been accredited to ISTQB standards (by one of the ISTQB-recognized Member Boards).

## Accreditation

An ISTQB® Member Board or its agent may accredit training providers whose course material follows this syllabus and the body of knowledge. Training providers should obtain accreditation guidelines from the Member Board or its agent that performs the accreditation. An accredited course is recognized as conforming to this syllabus and the body of knowledge, and is allowed to have an ISTQB® exam as part of the course.

The accreditation guidelines for \<module-code\> follow the general Accreditation Guidelines published by the Processes Management and Compliance Working Group.

## Handling of Standard

There may be standards referenced in the \<module-code\> Syllabus (e.g., IEEE, ISO, etc.). The purpose of these references is to provide a framework (as in the references to ISO 25010 regarding quality characteristics) or to provide a source of additional information if desired by the reader. Please note that the syllabus is using the standard documents as reference. The standards documents are not intended for examination. Refer to section References for Standards.

## Keeping It Current

The software industry changes rapidly. To deal with these changes and to provide the stakeholders with access to relevant and current information, the ISTQB working groups have created links on the www.istqb.org website, which refer to supporting documents and changes to standards. This information is not examinable under the Foundation syllabus.

## Level of Detail

The level of detail in this syllabus with the supporting body of knowledge document allows internationally consistent courses and exams. In order to achieve this goal, the syllabus consists of:

* General instructional objectives describing the intention of the \<module-name\>
* A list of terms that students must be able to recall
* Learning objectives for each knowledge area, describing the cognitive learning outcome to be achieved
* A description of the key concepts, including references to sources such as accepted literature or standards

The syllabus content is not a description of the entire knowledge area of software testing; it reflects the level of detail to be covered in \<module-code\> training courses. It focuses on test concepts and techniques that can apply to all software projects, including those following Agile methods.  This syllabus does not contain any specific learning objectives related to Agile testing, but it does discuss how these concepts apply in Agile projects and other types of projects.

## How this Syllabus is Organized {#how-this-syllabus-is-organized}
