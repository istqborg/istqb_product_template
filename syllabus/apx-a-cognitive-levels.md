# Learning Objectives/Cognitive Level of Knowledge {#cognitive-levels}

The specific learning objectives applying to this syllabus are shown at the beginning of each chapter. Each topic in the syllabus will be examined according to the learning objective for it.

The learning objectives begin with an action verb corresponding to its cognitive level of knowledge as listed below.

#### Level 1: Remember (K1)

The candidate will remember, recognize and recall a term or concept.

**Action verbs:** Recall, recognize.

| Examples |
| -------- |
| Recall the concepts of the test pyramid. |
| Recognize the typical objectives of testing. |

#### Level 2: Understand (K2)

The candidate can select the reasons or explanations for statements related to the topic, and can summarize, compare, classify and give examples for the testing concept.

**Action verbs**: Classify, compare, differentiate, distinguish, explain, give examples, interpret, summarize

| Examples | Notes |
| -------- | ----- |
| Classify test tools according to their purpose and the test activities they support. |     |
| Compare the different test levels. | Can be used to look for similarities, differences or both. |
| Differentiate testing from debugging. | Looks for differences between concepts. |
| Distinguish between project and product risks. | Allows two (or more) concepts to be separately classified. |
| Explain the impact of context on the test process. |     |
| Give examples of why testing is necessary. |     |
| Infer the root cause of defects from a given profile of failures. |     |
| Summarize the activities of the work product review process. |     |

#### Level 3: Apply (K3)

The candidate can carry out a procedure when confronted with a familiar task, or select the correct procedure and apply it to a given context.

**Action verbs**: Apply, implement, prepare, use

| Examples | Notes |
| -------- | ----- |
| Apply boundary value analysis to derive test cases from given requirements. | Should refer to a procedure / technique / process etc. |
| Implement metrics collection methods to support technical and management requirements. |     |
| Prepare installability tests for mobile apps. |     |
| Use traceability to monitor test progress for completeness and consistency with the test objectives, test strategy, and test plan. | Could be used in a LO that wants the candidate to be able to use a technique or procedure. Similar to 'apply'. |

#### Level 4: Analyze (K4)

The candidate can separate information related to a procedure or technique into its constituent parts for better understanding, and can distinguish between facts and inferences. Typical application is to analyze a document, software or project situation and propose appropriate actions to solve a problem or task.

**Action verbs:** Analyze, deconstruct, outline, prioritize, select.

| Examples | Notes |
| -------- | ----- |
| Analyze a given project situation to determine which black-box or experience-based test techniques should be applied to achieve specific goals. | Examinable only in combination with a measurable goal of the analysis.<br><br>Should be of form 'Analyze xxxx to xxxx' (or similar). |
| Prioritize test cases in a given test suite for execution based on the related product risks. |     |
| Select the appropriate test levels and test types to verify a given set of requirements. | Needed where the selection requires analysis. |

#### Level 5: Evaluate (K5)

The candidate may make judgments based on criteria and standards. He detects inconsistencies or fallacies within a process or product, determines whether a process or product has internal consistency and detects the effectiveness of a procedure as it is being implemented (e.g., determine if a scientist's conclusions follow from observed data.)

**Action verbs:** Assess, critique, evaluate, recommend

| Examples | Notes |
| -------- | ----- |
| Assess a test organization using either TPI Next or TMMi. |     |
| Critique the appropriateness of the test activities in an organization for the given context. |     |
| Evaluate an organization to determine the options for proper placement of the test team. | Should be restricted to the evaluation, not including the resulting solution (which would be K6) |
| Recommend measures to create acceptance of the changes by the people involved. |     |

#### Level 6: Create (K6)

The candidate puts elements together to form a coherent or functional whole. Typical application is to reorganize elements into a new pattern or structure, devise a procedure for accomplishing some task, or invent a product (e.g., build habitats for a specific purpose).

**Action verbs:** Create, design, develop, plan

| Examples | Notes |
| -------- | ----- |
| Create a test improvement plan considering change management issues with appropriate steps and actions. |     |
| Design an organizational structure for a given scope of a test process improvement program |     |
| Develop a defect management process for a testing organization, including the defect report workflow and communication |     |
| Plan and perform assessment interviews using a particular process or content-based model. |     |
