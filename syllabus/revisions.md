To write a revision history, create an unnumbered section with the class `revision-history` as follows:

```
# Revision History {- .revision-history}
```

This will produce the same output as the heading of this section.

You can list the revisions as follows:

``` md
| Version | Date | Remarks |
|---------|------|---------|
v0.1 | YYYY/MM/DD | Current internal template version
v0.0.2 | YYYY/MM/DD | Remaks can be split into more lines by using \% the percent sign which serves as a line break.
v0.0.1 | YYYY/MM/DD | Name of the version
the percent sign which serves as a line break.
```

This will produce the following output:

| Version | Date | Remarks |
|---------|------|---------|
v0.1 | YYYY/MM/DD | Current internal template version
v0.0.2 | YYYY/MM/DD | Remaks can be split into more lines by using \% the percent sign which serves as a line break.
v0.0.1 | YYYY/MM/DD | Name of the version
